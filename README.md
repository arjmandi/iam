# iam
## A network based on genuine users and access to genuine content

Main goal of iam was to build a self-sustained network with no central entity where everyone has "one and only one account" and each account has a rank score.

Research and development on iam started on the summer of 2018 and on July 2019 initial network tests over 40 AWS machines where sucessful and the project sucesseded in getting its first term sheet to start. But at the time I decided to spend time on BlueBit which we were developing in Miras Technologies. Then the codebase IP transfered but the main ideas remained open.

I created this reposiroty to share the deck as a proposal and the reason I didn't publish it on Scribd or Google Slides is to have a place where the ideas can start to form a new codebase. 

# iam Network
Decentralized mesh network of servers owned by people. Each server provides these services keeping the decentralized nature of the network:
• User verification
• Store the user ranking updates
• Content sharing
• P2P Chat

People join this network using their voice. They'll have a unique account and they can also trust that everybody else on the network owns "just one account" and no one is a bot.
Features:
• Put comment on every URL through a chrome extension
• Using iam to login to other services
• Encrypted chat
